Welcome to the website of the **Tech CRS**. This project attemts to provide approachable technological education for elected officials and their staffs. 

## Introduction

Technical illiteracy among elected leaders and their staff leads to a lack of skepticism about technological products that interfact with government. The website will consist of a "manifesto" detailing a general path to critically approach any new technology, regular in-depth articles about relevant technology, and a searchable dictionary of relevant terms, concepts, and buzzwords. This project is an attempt to use the pedagogy of critical technical practice to create and defend corporate skepticism in government. The intangible product of the product will be to outfit every representative or staffer with their own personal "Baloney Detection Kit," per Carl Sagan.  

I am a technological optimist. I fundamentally believe that technology hasn't changed the way we think, and that most technology has lead to better outcomes for everyone. I am, however, also a technological skeptic. It's these two things that I want to instill in our government: the potential for technology to do real good, and the parts of technology (corporate control, equity, openness, unintended consequences, iteration) that must be evaluated to ensure that good is done.

Equally important is mitigating the overly-cautious approach to new technology. Forcing self-driving cars to stay below 25 mph in a high-traffic environment does not make anyone safer, and indeed only serves to alienate communities and stakeholders from the potentials of the technology. However, letting Uber run wild with no regulation or reporting requirements gives too much away to corporate control. Striking that balance is an intuitive concept once one is familiar enough with the technology. That familiarity is what I want to develop.

## This Site

This site consists of a [glossary](/glossary) of tech terms, [articles](/blog) on current technologies relevant to government, and this page: an overview of how to approach technology and do right by your constituents.
